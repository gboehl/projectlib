The full papers can be found on my website: [gregorboehl.com](gregorboehl.com)

## `dime_mcmc`
### Codes for "DIME MCMC: A Swiss Army Knife for Bayesian Inference"

This features a notebook and resources to estimate the HANK model from the paper.

## `hockey_pc_bl.ipynb`
### Codes for "The Hockey Stick Phillips Curve and the Zero Lower Bound"

It is a notebook and should be self explanatory.

## `mp_spec`
### Codes for "Monetary Policy and Speculative Asset Markets"

A description is included in the README file in the folder.

## `obc_benchmarks`
### Code for the benchmarks in "Efficient Solution and Computation of Models with Occasionally Binding Constraints"

Contains the scripts for replicating the exercises in the paper. Admittedly, this is not well documented, but the main contribution is probably the package itself.

## `qe_bgs`
### Codes for "A Structural Investigation on Quantitative Easing" (with Gavin Goy and Felix Strobel)

A description is included in the README file in the folder.

## `yamls`
### A collection of model files for [pydsge](https://github.com/gboehl/pydsge)

A description of the models is included in the README file in the folder.
