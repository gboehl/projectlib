The full papers can be found on my [website](gregorboehl.com)

## Notebooks

The notebooks should be self explanatory.

* [hank_speed_boehl.ipynb](https://github.com/gboehl/projectlib/tree/master/hank_speed_boehl.ipynb): Codes for "HANK on Speed: Robust Nonlinear Solutions using Automatic Differentiation"
* [hockey_pc_bl.ipynb](https://github.com/gboehl/projectlib/tree/master/hockey_pc_bl.ipynb): Codes for "The Hockey Stick Phillips Curve and the Zero Lower Bound"
* [monetary_financing_boehl.ipynb](https://github.com/gboehl/projectlib/tree/master/monetary_financing_boehl.ipynb): Codes for "The Political Economy of Monetary Financing without Inflation"

## Folders

Some project codes cannot be condensed to a notebook and thus get their own folder. Most of them include a README file.

* [dime_mcmc](https://github.com/gboehl/projectlib/tree/master/dime_mcmc): Codes for "DIME MCMC: A Swiss Army Knife for Bayesian Inference". This features a notebook and resources to estimate the HANK model from the paper.
* [mp_spec](https://github.com/gboehl/projectlib/tree/master/mc_spec): Codes for "Monetary Policy and Speculative Asset Markets"
* [obc_benchmarks](https://github.com/gboehl/projectlib/tree/master/obc_benchmarks): Code for the benchmarks in "Efficient Solution and Computation of Models with Occasionally Binding Constraints". Contains the scripts for replicating the exercises in the paper. Admittedly, this is not well documented, but the main contribution is probably the package itself.
* [qe_bgs](https://github.com/gboehl/projectlib/tree/master/qe_bgs): Codes for "A Structural Investigation on Quantitative Easing"

## [yamls](https://github.com/gboehl/projectlib/tree/master/yamls)

A collection of model files for [pydsge](https://github.com/gboehl/pydsge). A description of the models is included in the README file in the folder.
