# Project Codes

The full papers can be found on my website: [gregorboehl.com](gregorboehl.com)

This repo contains:

0. `yamls`: a collection of *.yaml for several projects and non-projects (sort of like *.mod files for [pydsge](https://github.com/gboehl/pydsge)) 
1. `mp_spec`: Monetary Policy and Speculative Asset Markets 
2. `re_chaos`: On the Evolutionary Fitness of Rationality

The simulation code is written in Python. Although I used Python version 3.7+ the code should be backwards compatible and also run under Python 2.7 (not tested). I also didn't do any testing under Windows or Mac OS.

## `yamls`
### A collection of model files for [pydsge](https://github.com/gboehl/pydsge)

A description of the models is included in the README file in the folder.


## `mp_spec`
### Codes for "Monetary Policy and Speculative Asset Markets"

A description is included in the README file in the folder.

## `re_chaos`
### Codes for "On the Evolutionary Fitnes of Rationality" (with Cars Hommes)

(description coming soon)
